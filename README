This project creates development toolchain targetting ChipCrafts architecture
for supported platforms.

Toolchain consists of:
- compiler
- binutils
- c library (newlib)
- debugger
- make

Supported platorms:
- Linux x86_64
- Windows

Supported architectures:
- ccproc (MIPS)
- RISC-V

Toolchain components will be cloned from company repositories (by themselves
forks of open source projects). Note that component repositories all have branch
named 'chipcraft-master', which contains any necessary patches.

The main work is done by crosstool-ng (https://crosstool-ng.github.io/).
The tool is cloned from company repository (by itself fork of open source
project). Some patches were applied to ensure the tools works with our custom
repos. Note that those patches are held in branch named 'chipcraft-master'.


Build system uses autotools. Steps to build:
./bootstrap
./configure
make


Repositories are downloaded using git over ssh. It's required to set up an
alias named 'chipcraft-git' in ssh client configuration files. Examples of
such configuration ofr github and for localhost are available in
'resources/misc/' directory.

Note that you can disable specific platforms at configuration step and build
only specific platforms at make step:
./configure --disable-linux-toolchain
will shut off rules for building toolchain for Linux hosts
./configure --disable-windows-toolchain
will do the same for Windows hosts.
Controlling target architecture can be done with:
./configure --disable-mips
will shut off rules for building toolchain for ccproc (MIPS) architecture
./configure --disable-riscv
will do the same for RISC-V architecture.
After configuration is done you can invoke make like:
make linux
to only build Linux toolchain and
make windows
to only build Windwos toolchain.

It's possible to change repository URL for any of the downloaded components
during configuration step. It's also possible to customize location of
downloaded components (and even reuse already downloaded ones). See output of
'./configure --help' for more information.

To see list of available make targets, see output of 'make help'.
